# Workshop Repository: 27273477-ws
## Overview

This is your workshop repository. You must submit all your workshop
work using this repository. You should make as many commits as
possible as you are doing your workshops to avoid any lost work. Make
sure that you also update the remote github repository with your local
changes using the following command:

```
$ git push
```

To get any feedback that we might provide you, you must execute the
following command:

```
$ git pull
```

We will let you know when we have any comments available for
you. Please see the course website for more details:

## Workshop Directories

For each workshop you will be required to create a new directory
inside your git repository. We will typically mention what the name of
the workshop directory is within the workshop documentation, however,
the format is typically `wn` for workshop `n`. For example, for
workshop 2 you would create the directory `w02`.
